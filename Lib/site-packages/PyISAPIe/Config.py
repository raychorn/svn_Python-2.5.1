These parameters can be overridden if they are
changed during the import of the ISAPI handler.
"""

# Debug
#
# Used to differentiate between a development and
# production environment. This setting is not used
# internally, meaning that any changes here always
# require a restart or recycle.
#
Debug = True

# InterpreterMap
#
# Determines how separate interpreters are used.
# An interpreter consists of a totally isolated
# environment, although not GIL-independent.
#
# Default: None
# Values:
#   None  - Always use the same interpreter (faster)
#   "XXX" - Given by Env.XXX (i.e. SCRIPT_NAME)
#
InterpreterMap = None

# BufferSize
#
# The amount of data to buffer before sending. The
# buffering policy is strict, meaning that the exact
# size will be sent on each write - this provides
# predictable behavior.
#
# If the buffer in not exceeded when the handler
# exits, a content-length header is sent followed
# by the buffer contents. Otherwise, there are a
# few possibilities:
#
#   Client sends close header or not KeepAlive:
#     - No content length header
#     - Buffers and sends normally
#     - Connection closed
#
#   Keepalive:
#     - No content length header
#     - HTTP/1.1:
#         - Use chunked transfer encoding
#         - Chunk size == BufferSize,
#           or write size if 0
#     - HTTP/1.0:
#         - Implies KeepAlive == False
#
# Note: The buffer is allocated on the stack
# for speed - keep an eye on your stack usage
# if you go over 64K, the recommended minimum.
#
# Default: None (output on each write)
# Range:   64-131072
#
BufferSize = 65536

# KeepAlive
#
# Use to disable chunked transfer
# encoding for HTTP/1.1 and always
# close the connection.
#
# Default: True
#
KeepAlive = True

# DefaultHeaders
#
# Headers to send (when none have been set) on
# the first write.
#
# Note that output is not considered sent when
# it goes into the buffer.
# Also, don't try to include any \r's, \n's or
# multi-line strings in general - it will only
# confuse the client. To specify a close header,
# use Header(Close=True) for correct behavior.
#
# The most efficient way to specify content
# length is to use Header(Length=NNNN).
#
DefaultHeaders = ( \
    "Content-Type: text/plain",
)
